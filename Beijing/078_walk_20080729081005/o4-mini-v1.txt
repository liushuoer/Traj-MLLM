Reasoning:
* All segment maximum speeds are below 7 m/s (6.7, 5.0, 3.1, 2.0 m/s), which fits within the walking speed limit and rules out bike, bus, car, and train.
* Maximum accelerations never exceed 3 m/s², consistent with human walking and below thresholds for motorized modes.
* The trajectory line meanders through sidewalks, pedestrian cut‐throughs, and crosses signalized intersections on footpaths rather than following dedicated vehicle lanes or railway tracks.
* Frequent stops (minimum speeds down to 0 m/s) and low average speeds (~1–2 m/s) match typical walking behavior in an urban environment.
