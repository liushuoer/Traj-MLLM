Final Judgment: Abnormal

Reasoning:  
1. Overall Assessment  
   - Although most of the trajectory correctly hugs the centreline of Rua do Campo Alegre and Rua de Diogo Botelho, the very beginning of the trip clearly cuts through parkland rather than following any mapped street.  

2. Evidence Analysis  
   - In the close-up Road Network View of the start region (highlighted by the green box), the bright green trajectory line proceeds straight north–south through the “Campo Alegre” park. There is no corresponding blue road segment there. Instead it should have followed the street Rua de Júlio Dinis (visible as a vertical blue line slightly to the east) or joined Rua do Campo Alegre directly, but the trajectory is offset about 50–100 m into the park.  
   - After this erroneous park crossing, the vehicle rejoins Rua do Campo Alegre and for the remainder of the trip (segments over Rua do Campo Alegre and later Rua de Diogo Botelho) the green line aligns very closely with the thin blue road lines. These later sections exhibit only normal, minor GPS jitter.  

3. Conclusion  
   - Because the trip begins with a clear geometric translation—cutting straight through a non-road area—the trajectory contains an abnormal segment and must be classified as Abnormal.
