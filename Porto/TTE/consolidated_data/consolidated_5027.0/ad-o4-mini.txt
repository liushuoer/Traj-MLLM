Final Judgment: Normal

Reasoning:
1. Overall Assessment  
   The entire trajectory (bright green) adheres closely to the simplified road network (thin blue lines). At every step—from the motorway entrance ramps through the long arterial segments and the winding residential streets—the green track runs exactly on top of the corresponding blue road segments, showing only the small, expected GPS‐style jitter rather than a systematic parallel shift.

2. Evidence Analysis  
   - In the motorway interchange close-ups (third and fourth close-up Road Network Views), the green line follows every curve of the “Via de Cintura Interna” ramps without an offset.  
   - On the long straight segment down “Avenida Conselheiro da Europa” (fifth Road Network View), the green trajectory lies squarely centered on the blue road line, with no visible displacement.  
   - In the residential area with tight corners (first and second close-up Road Network Views), every turn of the green path coincides exactly with the network of minor streets (e.g., Rua de Gonçalo Cristóvão, Rua da Constituição), with no section running through buildings or green spaces.  
   - Across all segmented views, junction nodes (red dots) line up directly under or very close to the green track, confirming there is no segment running off the mapped roads.

3. Conclusion  
   Because every portion of the trajectory matches the underlying road geometry—with no obvious translated or offset segments—the trajectory is judged to be Normal.
