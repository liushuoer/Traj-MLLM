Final Judgment: Normal

Reasoning:
1. Overall Assessment  
   The trajectory closely follows the mapped road network throughout its entire course, with the bright green line aligning to the thin blue road lines—including straight segments, loop ramps, and intersection approaches—indicating no obvious geometric shift off the roads.

2. Evidence Analysis  
   – In the global Road Network View, the trajectory runs south on the north–south arterial (工农路) exactly on the corresponding blue line, then uses the loop ramp to merge onto the ring road (环城北路) without any lateral offset.  
   – In the close-up of the ramp segment, the green trajectory hugs the curved blue ramp line, matching the loop geometry precisely and showing vehicle travel on the correct elevated/ground-level roadway.  
   – Along the ring road segment, the green line lies directly atop the blue dual-carriageway lines, with no parallel or shifted paths visible, even across multiple junctions.  
   – Finally, the segment approaching the terminal intersection onto 莲湖路 also coincides perfectly with the mapped road alignment in the POI‐overlaid view.

3. Conclusion  
   Because every examined segment adheres to its respective road alignment, with no parts of the trajectory running through non‐road areas or clearly offset from the blue road lines, this trajectory is classified as Normal.
