Final Judgment: Normal

Reasoning:

1. Overall Assessment  
   The entire bright-green trajectory adheres closely to the thin blue road centerlines on every portion of its path. There are no obvious parallel offsets or detours across non-road areas; the vehicle remains consistently on the mapped carriageways from origin to destination.

2. Evidence Analysis  
   • In the global Road Network View, the green path follows the major arterial (曲江街道/美蓉东路) exactly through its length, including the elevated interchange.  
   • In close-up segment images of the highway section (segments 1–3), the trajectory lies in the center of the blue motorway lines without deviation onto adjacent off-ramps or service roads.  
   • At the cloverleaf interchange (segment 4), the green trace remains on the main through-road, not on the surrounding sliproads, indicating proper road matching rather than a shifted trajectory.  
   • Upon turning north onto the side street (segment 5), the vehicle track lines up perfectly with the single blue line of 雁塔西路, with no lateral gap.  
   • Finally, the right turn onto 慈恩路 (segment 6) and subsequent approach into the mall parking access roads (segment 7) continue to match the blue centerlines exactly, showing no evidence of GPS-offset drift into non-road space.

3. Conclusion  
   All examined segments demonstrate precise alignment between the trajectory and the mapped road network. There are no translated (parallel shifted) sections running through non-road areas. Therefore, this trajectory is Normal.
