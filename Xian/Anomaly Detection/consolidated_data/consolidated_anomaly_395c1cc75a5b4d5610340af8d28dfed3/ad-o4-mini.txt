Final Judgment: Abnormal

Reasoning:  
1. Overall Assessment  
   The provided trajectory does not adhere closely to the mapped roads. While the initial turn onto the local street roughly follows the blue network, the majority of the ride—especially on the 2nd Ring Road—is shifted off the actual carriageways by several meters, running between lanes or through non-road areas.

2. Evidence Analysis  
   - Zoomed Highway Segments (Road Network View images 4 and 5):  
     In these close-up views of the north–south 2nd Ring Road, the bright green trajectory lies squarely between the two directions of travel (i.e. down the median), rather than along either mapped carriageway. No blue road line occupies that center strip. This is a textbook geometric translation of the vehicle path off the real lanes.  
   - Global Road Network View (first image):  
     At the junction where the vehicle departs the main road to the west, the green line starts its turn about 10–15 m north of the mapped blue street, cutting through what appears to be a courtyard or park area before snapping onto the intended residential road.  
   - Other Segments:  
     The short linking segment on the residential grid matches the network adequately, but this isolated correct match does not outweigh the clear parallel shifts on the major arterial.

3. Conclusion  
   Because multiple segments—most notably the highway portion—are consistently displaced from the true road geometry (running between carriageways and through non-road space), the trajectory is considered abnormal.
