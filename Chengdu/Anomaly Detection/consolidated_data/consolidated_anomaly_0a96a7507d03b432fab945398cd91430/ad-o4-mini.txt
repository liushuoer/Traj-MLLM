Final Judgment: Abnormal

Reasoning:
1. Overall Assessment  
   - Most of the trajectory (the long, straight portions) follows the main north–south expressway and then the east–west Ring Road, matching the blue road network with only minor GPS jitter.  

2. Evidence Analysis  
   - Zoomed Insets (fifth and sixth images): There is a distinct segment where the green trajectory line departs the blue-lined roads. Instead of staying on the service road or slip-road parallel to the expressway, the trajectory veers sharply southwest into a grid of side-streets, makes a triangular loop through an area with no corresponding through-road, and then jumps back to the main expressway corridor.  
   - This “zig-zag” path cuts across building blocks and open parcels—an area with no continuous blue road link—indicating a geometric translation error rather than actual vehicle motion.  
   - Contrast with other segments (first through fourth images): The green line tightly hugs the blue expressway lanes and on‐ramps, showing correct map‐matching elsewhere.

3. Conclusion  
   - The isolated, offset loop through non-existent roads is a clear shifted segment anomaly. The trajectory cannot be normal given this geometric inconsistency.
