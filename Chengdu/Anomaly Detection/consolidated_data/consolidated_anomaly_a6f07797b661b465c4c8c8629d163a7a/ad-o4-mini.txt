**Final Judgment:** Abnormal

**Reasoning:**

1. Overall Assessment  
   – While the eastern portion of the trip (along the north–south arterial and then the main east–west boulevard) adheres closely to the blue road network, there is a clearly misplaced stretch in the western segment.

2. Evidence Analysis  
   – In the close-up “Road Network View” of the western end (first image), the bright green path cuts diagonally across an entire block. The true roads form a rectangular loop—west on 方正东路, south on 忠烈祠西街, west again, and then back north—but the trajectory ignores them and runs straight through what appear to be buildings and interior alleys.  
   – In the global map, you can also spot two long, parallel diagonal strokes in the westernmost section that do not align with any blue line. They slice across multiple property parcels instead of tracking the genuine L-shaped roadway.  
   – All other segments (the north-south approach, the turn onto 新华大道玉沙路, and the long straight east-west run) coincide well with the official road network (as seen in the segmented Road Network Views in the center of the sequence).

3. Conclusion  
   Because one continuous stretch in the western part of the trajectory is clearly translated off the true roads—running parallel but offset and cutting through non-road areas—the trajectory contains an anomalous, shifted segment.
