Final Judgment: Normal

Reasoning:

1. Overall Assessment  
   The green trajectory line in the Road Network views adheres closely to the thin blue road centerlines from start to finish. There are no obvious parallel offsets or segments cutting across non-road areas.

2. Evidence Analysis  
   – Global Road-Network Views (first two images): The bright green line lies directly atop the blue roads, including the long north–south segment on the major arterial and the eastward turn at the interchange. At every red node (road junction), the trajectory intersects exactly at the mapped road center.  
   – Close-up Road-Network View (last image): The vertical portion of the green line perfectly matches the main carriageway; it does not run beside or offset into adjacent blocks. All side-street connections align at their true junction points.  
   – POI (colored) Views (middle images): The red trajectory overlay follows the visible asphalt roads through all intersections and bends, with no excursions into parks, buildings, or open spaces. Even in the detailed insets around the turn and the start point, the track remains on the mapped pavement.

3. Conclusion  
   Every examined segment of the trajectory accurately follows the underlying road network. There is no evidence of geometric translation or anomalous offsets. Therefore, the trajectory is classified as Normal.
